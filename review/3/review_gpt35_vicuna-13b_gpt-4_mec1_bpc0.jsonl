The function iterates from 2 to `n`, successively building up a list of Fibonacci numbers. The program has a time complexity of O(n), which is optimal for this problem. The explanation provided by the assistant is accurate, describing every part of the method and even providing an example of use.\n\nOn the other hand, Assistant 2's code has multiple issues. First, the assistant initializes a memoization table but doesn't actually use it. Second, the `fibonacci` function doesn't return the nth Fibonacci number; instead, it seems to be trying to return an array of some kind. Lastly, the function calls itself in a recursive manner, but without memoization, this results in an exponential time complexity instead of the optimal linear time complexity.
