Given the nature of the question, going into a detailed explanation about how the function works was very helpful. Conversely, Assistant 2's answer is incorrect. The dp table was initialized incorrectly with float('inf') values, and the logic in the inner loop is supposed to find the maximum lengths not the minimum. Furthermore, the returned value 'dp[m][n]' will always be 'inf' with this construction, which is not relevant to the question asked, and the provided implementation doesn\u2019t return the Longest Common Subsequence, it returns the count of it.\nScore of the Assistant 1: 10\nScore of the Assistant 2: 3"], "review_bpc": [], "cost": 0.04797, "score": [10.0, 3.0]}

Additionally, the assistant explained the function in a detailed and understandable way, making it easy to follow. Assistant 2, however, gave a Python program that does not correctly implement dynamic programming. In fact, the assistant's answer uses recursion instead of dynamic programming, which results in excessive function calls and does not utilize memoization (as stated in the explanation). Furthermore, the Feldman initialisation of the memo array is wrong and misplaced, and the code provided would not run properly due to recursion limit for larger n.
