Assistant 1 employed a relatively straightforward approach by taking the average grain of salt weight from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and calculating the number of atoms based on molecular weight and Avogadro's number. Assistant 2, on the other hand, calculated the number of atoms based on the physical dimensions of an average grain of salt. However, they made a significant error by stating that a grain of salt might be composed of a singular element, which is never the case as salt is composed of sodium and chlorine.
