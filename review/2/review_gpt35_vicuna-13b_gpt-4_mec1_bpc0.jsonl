Moreover, the function entered into an endless loop as there were no conditions to stop the recursion. In the explanation, Assistant 2 mentioned Binet's formula but didn't explain or show how to use it.\n\nScore of the Assistant 1: 10\nScore of the Assistant 2: 4"], "review_bpc": [], "cost": 0.03405, "score": [10.0, 4.0]}

They explained how to use the function and explained the logic behind binary search, where an element in the middle of a portion of an array is compared to the target value. If the target value is not equal to that element, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the process repeats on the remaining half until it is successful or the remaining half is empty. Assistant 1 gave a practical test case and the way to handle the returned value which is quite helpful for those who want to know how to use this function. However, Assistant 2 pointed out the time complexity of Binary Search as O(log n) and stated that the algorithm is most efficient when used with a sorted array which is useful additional information.
