It is built on dynamic programming principles, storing calculated Fibonacci numbers in a list and using these found values to calculate subsequent Fibonacci numbers. This is a time and memory efficient way to calculate the nth Fibonacci number, correctly implementing dynamic programming, and Assistant 1 provided a good explanation of this fact.\n\nIn contrast, Assistant 2's program is incorrect. They discuss building the memoization table but the code provided does not do so. Instead it simply runs recursive calls for fibonacci(n-1) and fibonacci(n-2) without ever referring to the memoization table setup. This method would actually lead to significant inefficiencies for larger 'n', as the same values would need to be recalculated multiple times.
