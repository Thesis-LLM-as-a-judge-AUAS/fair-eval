They accurately outlined the steps explaining the details of enqueue and dequeue operations, handling the empty queue scenario, and also providing queue size and is_empty function which is a standard operation in any queue implementation. Hence, the answer from Assistant 1 is highly helpful and relevant to the user's question. \n\nOn the other hand, Assistant 2 seemed to misunderstand the question. Even though the question asks for Python implementation, the assistant provided a mix of Python and C++ code. Despite this, the code itself has logical flaws; In the enqueue function, it also clears the out_stack which could potentially remove all dequeued items. Also, in the dequeue function, it isn't properly implementing the logic of a queue. More so, the `peek` function and `EmptyQueueError` exception handling are not required in a standard queue implementation.\n\nIn conclusion, Assistant 1 provided a much more relevant, accurate and detailed response than Assistant 2.\n\nScore of the Assistant 1: 10\nScore of the Assistant 2: 2"], "review_bpc": [], "cost": 0.04026, "score": [10.0, 2.0]}

In Assistant 1's solution, there is an explicit check to avoid duplicates by checking the 'common' list before appending an element to it. But this operation of checking an element in a list can be costly in terms of time complexity, making it a less efficient method even though this particular method does not violate the \"no extra data structures\" rule of the question. On the other hand, Assistant 2's solution did not aim to avoid duplicates and would output duplicates if there are any in both the initial arrays which might not be the desired output in most of the cases. However, it strictly adhered to the \"no extra data structures\" rule but at the cost of potentially having repeated elements in the output. \n\nScore of the Assistant 1: 8\nScore of the Assistant 2: 7"], "review_bpc": [], "cost": 0.03132, "score": [8.0, 7.0]}
