Both correctly explained how vaccines prime the immune system to fight off future infections by presenting it with a deactivated or weakened form of a virus or bacteria. They both also nicely clarified what herd immunity is, and how it functions within a community. The difference lies in the level of detail. Assistant 2 gave a more comprehensive account, mentioning the exact population percentage typically needed to achieve herd immunity and highlighting the societal benefits that arise from each individual getting vaccinated. The answer also included examples of individuals who are unable to get vaccinated and hence most benefit from herd immunity.
