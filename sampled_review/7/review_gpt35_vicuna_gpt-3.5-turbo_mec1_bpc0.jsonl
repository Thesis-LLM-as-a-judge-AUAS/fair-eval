They break down the process logically, starting with how lightning is formed, moving on to the frequency of thunderstorms, the percentage of thunderstorms that produce lightning, and finally estimating the average number of lightning strikes per thunderstorm. However, Assistant 1 acknowledges the variance in estimates from different sources, which shows awareness of the complexity of the topic.\n\nAssistant 2's response, on the other hand, provides a more general explanation without delving into specific calculations or source references. While they touch on the causes of lightning and the general conditions that influence the number of strikes, the estimate they provide (100,000,000 strikes per day) seems overly high compared to widely accepted figures. They acknowledge the variability based on weather conditions but do not provide a nuanced breakdown of how that variability affects the estimates.\n\nConsidering these points, Assistant 1's response is more comprehensive, accurate, and helpful in explaining the estimated number of lightning strikes per day based on a logical calculation process.
