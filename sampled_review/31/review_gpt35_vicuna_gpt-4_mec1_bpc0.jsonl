Assistant 1 correctly provides a Python implementation of a queue using two stacks while explaining the working of the code and also how to test it. On the other hand, Assistant 2's response has some significant issues. Firstly, the code written is contradictory to the question as it shows imitation in CPP language while the question specifically asked for Python. Secondly, the logic used for the implementation is flawed because items are transferred to `out_stack` unnecessarily when `enqueue` is called.

They also arrived at the wrong answer, proving that their method was incorrect. Their solution was not relevant to the problem.
