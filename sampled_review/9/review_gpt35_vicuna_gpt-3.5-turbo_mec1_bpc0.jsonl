The assistant began by explaining the process of lightning formation and then proceeded to break down the estimation based on thunderstorm frequency, lightning occurrence rate, and average strikes per thunderstorm. The response included references to relevant sources and acknowledged the variability in estimates. However, it should be noted that the range of estimates provided by Assistant 1 was quite wide, which might affect the accuracy of the final estimate.\n\nAssistant 2, on the other hand, gave a more general response without delving into specific calculations or detailed reasoning. The explanation focused on the factors influencing lightning strikes, such as electrical charge buildup, weather conditions, and geographic location. While the assistant provided an estimate of 100,000,000 lightning strikes per day, it lacked the in-depth analysis and breakdown seen in Assistant 1's response.
